## Description:
### User Story:
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


### My Modifications:
#### List of the changes in html:
     1- I created a sample portfolio for my potential employer with my previous work by loading my portfolio.
     2- I presented with the my name as a developer, added a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me by clicking one of the links in the navigation.
     3- The UI scrolls to the corresponding section as I anckored the navigation to section about my work.
     4- I anckored the link to the section about my work the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the applications
     5- I linked my first project and presented as image for my first project as that image is larger in size than the others.
     6- I click on the images of the applications and I am taken to that deployed application.
     7- I resized the page on various screens and devices with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport
